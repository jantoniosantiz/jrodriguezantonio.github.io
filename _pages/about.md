I’m **Juliana J. Antonio**, a computational and theoretical chemist dedicated to uncovering how molecular interactions shape the world around us.  

Currently a doctoral candidate at **Southern Methodist University**, my research utilizes advanced modeling techniques, simulation, and data analysis to explore **artificial metalloenzymes**, **supramolecular design**, and **materials with real-world impact**.

I am passionate about:
- Applying computational chemistry to solve complex challenges in materials and catalysis.
- Mentoring the next generation of scientists.
- Science communication and policy.

 Research Highlights
========
- **Mutated Myoglobin Studies via QM/MM** – Elucidating structural and electronic effects of mutations on heme reactivity.  
- **Local Vibrational Mode Theory Applications** – Quantifying bond strength and reactivity trends in metal–ligand interactions.  
- **Ansa-Metallocenes with Group 2 Metals** – Exploring bonding characteristics and reactivity using quantum chemical methods.
